## Introduction

This is the RMD file (rendered HTML if you are viewing it on RPubs) for my YouTube video on using R for biostatistics.  Download the RMD file from Github and add your own notes during the tutorial!

## Libraries

Installing R provides the core or base language.  R can be extended using libraries (packages).  These can be installed using the Package tab (right-bottom of the default interface).

```{r Libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tibble)  # Modern dataframes
library(readr)  # Imports and exports spreadsheet files
library(dplyr)  # Tidy data analysis
library(DT)  # Displays HTML tables
```


## Simple arithmetic

At its heart, many computer languages are giant, fancy calculators.  Below is some code for simple arithmetic and common mathematical functions.

```{r Addition}
2 + 2 + 4
```

```{r Subtraction}
2 - 5 - 4
```

```{r Multiplication}
2 * 4 * 3
```

```{r Division}
3 / 4
```

```{r Powers}
3^3
```

```{r Arithmetical order}
(2 + 4) * 3
```

```{r Exponents base e}
exp(1) # e to the power of 1
```

```{r Logarithms base 10}
log10(1000) 
```

```{r Logarithms base e (default)}
# To change the exponential
log(1000, 
    base = exp(1))
```

## Lists

Lists are object that contain elements, separated by commas.  These can be numbers or words.

```{r List of systolic blood pressures (numerical values)}
c(120, 120, 110, 130, 140)
```

```{r List of diseases (strings)}
c("Pneumonia", "ARDS", "Chronic bronchitis")
```

## Computer variables

Lists (among other things) can be stored in your computer's memory as an object.  The name given to the object is called a computer variable.

```{r Systolic blood pressure}
sbp <- c(120, 120, 110, 130, 140)
```

```{r Calling the sbp list object}
sbp
```

```{r A sequence}
# There are rules for computer variable names
# Below is an example of snake-case
patient.number <- seq(from = 0,
                      to = 100,
                      by = 2)
patient.number
patient.number[1] # You can access a certain item in this list
```

## Addressing

Every element in a object has an address that can be referenced.

```{r First systolic blood presssure}
sbp[1]
```

```{r First three systolic blood pressures}
sbp[1:3]
```

```{r First and third systolic blood pressures}
sbp[c(1, 3)]
```

## Distributions

Data point values for a variable are distributed according to a pattern, called a distribution.
Dr. Juan here teaches how to build a simulated dataset
```{r Uniform distribution}
set.seed(123)  # Forces a specific selection of values
age <- sample(18:85,
              500,
              replace = TRUE) # Permets the repition of certain numbers
```

```{r Standard normal distribution}
set.seed(123)
before.after <- rnorm(500)
```

```{r Normal distribution}
set.seed(123)
sbp <- round(rnorm(500, # round() to escape decimal values
                   mean = 120,
                   sd = 20),
             digits = 0)
```

```{r Chi-squared distribution}
set.seed(123)
crp <- round(rchisq(500, # Chi-square distribution
                    df = 2), # Two degrees of freedom VERY IMPORTANT
             digits = 1)
```

```{r Random choice}
set.seed(123)
group <- sample(c("Control",
                  "Placebo"),
                500,
                replace = TRUE)
```

```{r Random choice with weights}
set.seed(123)
side.effects <- sample(c("No",
                         "Yes"),
                       500,
                       replace = TRUE,
                       prob = c(0.8, 
                                0.2)) # probability of being selected
```

## Descriptive statistics

The first part of the analysis of data is descriptive statistics.

```{r Mean age}
mean(age)
```

```{r Median age}
median(age)
```

```{r Variance in age}
var(age)
```

```{r Standard deviation of age}
sd(age)
```

```{r Min and max age}
range(age)
```

```{r Interquartile range of age}
IQR(age)
```

```{r First quartile of age}
quantile(age,
         0.25)
```

```{r Third quartile of age}
quantile(age,
         0.75)
```

```{r Summary of age}
summary(age)
```

```{r Sample space of group variable}
unique(group)
```

## Data visualization

After describing the data, more information can be gained from visualizing it.

### Box-and-whisker plot

```{r Box plot}
boxplot(age)
```

```{r Box plot with title, axes labels, color}
boxplot(age,
        col = "deepskyblue",
        main = "Patient age",
        xlab = "Patients",
        ylab = "Age")
```

### Histogram

```{r Histogram of before.after}
hist(before.after,
     col = "pink",
     main = "Difference in measurement before and after treatment",
     xlab = "Measurment",
     ylab = "Counts")
```

### Scatter plot

```{r Scatter plot of numerical pairs}
plot(age,
     sbp,
     col = "blue",
     main = "Age vs systolic blood pressure",
     xlab = "Age",
     ylab = "Systolic blood pressure")
```

## Tibbles

Data for analysis are typically stored in dataframes.  These are rows and columns of data.  Each column represents a variable and each row contains the data point values for a specific subject.

### Creating a tibble

```{r Creating a tibble from the data}
my.data <- tibble(Age = age,
                  Difference = before.after,
                  CRP = crp,
                  Group = group,
                  sBP = sbp,
                  SideEffects = side.effects)
```

### Exporting a tibble

```{r Exporting the tibble as a csv file}
write_csv(my.data,
          "Data.csv")
```

## Importing data

Data in a spreadsheet file can be imported for analysis.

```{r Importing dataset, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Spreadhseet file is in same folder as this RMD file
# setwd(getwd()) was used initially
# Need only refer to file name (else use the full folder address)
data <- read_csv("ProjectData.csv")
```

## Inspecting the data

```{r Data table}
datatable(data)
```

## Selections

Subsets of a dataframe can be selected based on chosen rules.

```{r Create new tibble of control group}
control.group <- data %>% filter(Group == "I")
```

```{r Patients younger than 50}
younger.patients <- data %>% filter(Age < 50)
```

```{r Only sBP and CRP for younger patients}
younger.patients.select <- data %>% filter(Age < 50) %>% 
  select(sBP,
         CRP)
```

```{r Younger patients in group II}
younger.patients.II <- data %>% filter((Age < 50) & Group == "I")
```

## Descriptive statistics of the new data

### Age by group

```{r Mean age by group}
data %>% 
  group_by(Group) %>% 
  summarise(mean.age = mean(Age))
```

### Side-effect count

```{r Counting side-effects}
data %>% group_by(SideEffects) %>% 
  summarise(count = n())
```

### Side effects by group

```{r Side-effects by group }
data %>% 
  group_by(Group) %>% 
  count(SideEffects)
```

## Visualizing the new data

### Box plot of age by group

```{r Box plot of age given the group}
boxplot(Age ~ Group,
        data = data,
        col = c("deepskyblue", "orange"),
        main = "Age distribution by group",
        xlab = "Group",
        ylab = "Age",
        las = 1)
```

```{r Scatter plot of systolic BP given the age}
plot(sBP ~ Age,
     data = data,
     col = "blue",
     main = "Age vs systolic blood pressure",
     xlab = "Age",
     ylab = "Systolic blood pressure",
     las = 1)
```

## Inferential statistics

### Student's _t_ test

```{r Student t test}
t.test(sBP ~ Group,
       data,
       alternative = c("two.sided"),
       mu = 0,
       paired = FALSE,
       var.equal = TRUE,
       conf.level = 0.95)
```

### Linear regression

```{r Predicting systolic blood pressure given age}
summary(lm(sBP ~ Age,
           data = data))
```

### $\chi^2$ test for independence

```{r Reminder of side-effects per group}
data %>% 
  group_by(Group) %>% 
  count(SideEffects)
```

```{r Group vs side-effects contingency table}
grpI <- c(137,
          114)
grpII <- c(152,97)
nrows <- 2
group.side.effect.matrix <- matrix(c(grpI,
                                     grpII),
                                   nrow = nrows,
                                   byrow = TRUE)
rownames(group.side.effect.matrix) <- c("Group I",
                                        "Group II")
colnames(group.side.effect.matrix) <- c("No",
                                       "Yes")
group.side.effect.matrix
```

```{r Chi-squared test for independence}
chisq.test(group.side.effect.matrix,
           correct = FALSE)
```
